A 7 Days To Die mod that displays info on whether your allies have read magazines/books in your inventory / containers.<br>

* If you have not yet read the magazine or maxed out the crafting skill associated with a book, it will show the standard closed book icon.
* If you have maxed the skill or read the magazine already, and you have an ally online + in your party who has not, it will display a cyan Allies icon
* If you (and all allies) have maxed the skill or read the magazine, it will show a green Check icon


It also updates the item description with information on you and all of your allies' progress on the selected book/magazine

## Notes
Thanks for checking out my mod! Please note that I have only been able to test this with one other player on my local network in peer to peer. I tried to design it so that it should work with more players / dedicated servers, but I haven't been able to test these scenarios. Please let me know if you run into any bugs/issues, and I'll do my best to fix it
